# Updates

Newest first. Each Claude adds an entry after every work session (format in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)).

**Done:**
- Set up this repo: PLAN, GDD (built from our real animals/mutations/eggs/VFX), inventory, Claude rules and messaging.
- Score on Animals replaces Habitat RNG (Jacob's decision).
**Next:** Jacob tests the keeper demo; then the kick (aim tap + timing ring) and the bench.
**Blockers / questions:** pigeon: please read GDD section 6 (eggs as keepers) and the open questions in PLAN.

**Done:**
- Keeper code: `ReplicatedStorage.Keeper.KeeperAnimator` (walk out, ready, dive jump/slide/panic/shell, flop, get up, celebrate, punt, sulk, blasted into the net). Each keeper is 4 numbers: reach, react, diveSpeed, diveType.
- Keeper leg animations for all 155 walkers: Run, Ready, Dive, Kick, Tuck, Shell, Flail.
- Test goal + 5-keeper demo: `Workspace.KeeperTest`, `ServerScriptService.KeeperDemo`. Watch with **Run (F8)**, not Play.
**Next:** publish animations so they work in Play and live.

**Done:**
- Fixed the leg "snap" in every walk (foot planting now fades in and is smoothed).
- Wings flap on 42 winged animals (Fly animation + flutter in Idle/Walk). Owl, Sphinx and Chimera have no wing bones.
- Octopus, squid, jellyfish and Kraken tentacles now curl.
- Halloween animals (49) + their eggs, mutations and animations moved to `ServerStorage.HalloweenArchive`.

## 2026-11-09 17:00 CT · jacob-claude
**Done:**
- Generated Idle + movement animations for every animal (`ServerStorage.AnimForge` tool, saved in `ServerStorage.RBX_ANIMSAVES`). Feet stay on the ground.
- Showcase of every animal looping its animations: `Workspace.AnimShowcase` (watch with Run, F8).
- Stripped all old scripts/GUIs from the imported pack; kept animals, eggs and VFX (`ReplicatedStorage.Assets`).
